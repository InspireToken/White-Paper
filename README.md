Inspire Token (INS) A decentralised oracle network on TRON Abstract. Smart contract is one of the most important parts of moder n blockchains. Smart contracts are deployed on blockchains, triggered automatically and cannot be modified after deployed. These characteri stics make smart contracts the best solution for traditional digital contracts. However, smart contracts cannot communicate with data outs ide the blockchains. Based on this problem, we propose a solution to this. The solution is called an oracle. An oracle connects the off-chain wo rld with smart contracts. Differ from most existing oracles, Inspire Token is a decentralised oracle network, which provides more secure service s than the normal ones. This paper details the on-chain components for smart contracts connect ting with the off-chain world and the underlying modules of Inspire Token nodes. Probable optimizations are also included in this paper, which illustrates the directions for Inspire Token in the future.
